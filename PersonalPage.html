<p style="text-align: center">
As a third year student at the University of Georgia, I have learned many things. My major is Sports Management which involves the inner workings of businesses in or around the sports industry. My dream job is to work for a major sports team or agency after graduation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I chose my major because growing up I loved and played just about every sport for many years. I thought that if I could find a job in this field I would be extremely happy and would love going to work each and every day. As a kid my favorite team was the Atlanta Braves for many reasons. You can find some additional information about my favorite <A href="https://www.mlb.com/braves">team here.</a>

<p><b>Current Classes</b></p>
<table border=2>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Credits</td></tr>
<tr><td>KINS 3415</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>CSCI 1100</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>GEOG 1100</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>LEGL 1100</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="text-align:left"> These are the classes I am currently taking this semester. Two of these (LEGL 1100 and KINS 3415) are directly associated with my major while the other two are just elective courses. After this semester, I will have a little over 80 credits and will have to take 15 credits next semester. If I can stay on this pace to graduate, I should be able to reach my dream job in a few short years!</p>
